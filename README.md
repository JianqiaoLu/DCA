# assigments for convex optimization
the difficult part for solving the hessain part has already written in the .pdf
I will just give a overview for different function defined in assignment3.m
---
'plot_homework' will give three different figure corresponding to three requirements in (e) of the assignment

' Prime_Dual_IPM' is where we get the U and L

' get_residual' can get the residual value of r_cent and r_dual

' get_search_direction'is the function help sovle updating direction for prime_variable : f and L, dual_variable.

' single_hessain_fix' can get single_hessain of inequatily constraint for Rf - c<0 and f <0 and R/(c - Rf) < L

' inequality_constraint' can get value of inequality constraint for Rf - c<0 and f <0 and R/(c - Rf) < L

' total_gradient_fix'can get gradient of inequality constraint for Rf - c<0 and f <0 and R/(c - Rf) < L
